# To DOER📝
## A Todo App, but On `Steroid` 💪 Built with React and Tailwindcss.
### This app is a *practice* project I made to sharpen my little react skills. This app is on steroid because unlike many other Todo apps, it will comprise the following features: 👇

## *Features that are striked-through are already implemented, but it could be made better thanks to your help*😊

>~~**`Task Prioritization`**~~: Allow users to set task priorities, such as High, Medium, and Low. This way, they can focus on important tasks first.

>**`Due Dates and Reminders`**: Enable users to set due dates for tasks and provide optional reminders to notify them before the deadline.

>**`Categories/Labels`**: Allow users to categorize their tasks with custom labels or predefined categories, making it easier to organize and filter tasks.

>**`Task Notes`**: Provide the ability to add additional notes or descriptions to tasks for more detailed information.

>**`Subtasks`**: Implement the ability to create subtasks within a task. This can help break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

>**`Task Sorting and Filtering`**: Add options to sort tasks based on due date, priority, or completion status. Also, provide filtering options to view specific categories or completed tasks.

>**`Drag-and-Drop`**: Allow users to reorder tasks and move them between categories using drag-and-drop functionality.

>**`Task Sharing`**: Enable users to share tasks or task lists with others, either through email, social media, or collaborative platforms.

>**`Task Progress Tracking`**: Show progress bars or completion percentages for tasks, giving users a visual representation of their productivity.

>**`Dark Mode`**: Implement a dark mode option for users who prefer a darker user interface.

>**`Recurring Tasks`**: Provide an option to set tasks as recurring, so they automatically reappear at specified intervals.

>**`Multiple Lists`**: Allow users to create and manage multiple todo lists, e.g., personal, work, shopping, etc.
